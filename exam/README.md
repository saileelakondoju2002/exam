## Current Limitations and TODO

1. Questions are currently hardcoded and need to be fetched from a quiz.txt file.
2. Camera access for test monitoring is not yet implemented.
3. The AI assistant provides generic responses and needs more sophisticated logic.
4. E-Certificate download functionality is not yet implemented.
5. Security measures like disabling right-click during tests are pending.
6. Proper state management for user data and test progress is needed.

## Next Steps

1. Implement question fetching from quiz.txt based on the selected subject.
2. Add camera access functionality for test monitoring.
3. Enhance AI assistant responses with more context-aware logic.
4. Implement E-Certificate generation and download functionality.
5. Add security measures to prevent cheating during tests.
6. Implement proper state management using Context API or Redux.
